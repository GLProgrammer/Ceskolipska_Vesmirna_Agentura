# Example python client for habdec websocket server

![alt text](./pyClientScreenshot.png)

This is simple example of python client demonstrating how to connect to habdec server. The code is kept (almost) to minimum and is not meant for anything serious - just a proof of concept.

You need `pip install ws4py` and numpy.

GUI is done with tkinter (which you should have with python). Use something better for real work.
